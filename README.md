search API over in-memory movies dataset


# Approach1

* Store the records in a database. 
* Query the db: `select * from movies where movie_name like "%'name'%" and movie_description like "%'desc'%"`



# API structure:

* Request: Searchable by both title and desc or either field. lowercase matching id one so its case insensitive.
    * GET request: `curl -i --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/search?title=kong&desc=godzilla'`
    * query params: `title` and `desc`

* Response: List of all first 5 matched movies.
    * Example:
